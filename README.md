# Week 2 - exercise - Bill Selig (ejalbos) version

## Introduction

This is the exercicse in which we are going to create a new repository, author an RSpec test that fails, and then push that test up to Github. Then we are going to find a -victim-, I mean friend, that will fork our repository, fix the test, and then submit a 'pull request' with that fix.

- fork this to your github
- clone that to your local box
- fix the tests
- push it back to your repo
- send me a pull request
